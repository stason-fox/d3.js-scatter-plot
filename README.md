# d3.js Scatter Plot

#### Description: Scatter plot created with d3.js. Tools used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

I created a scatter plot using d3.js that displays doping allegations in professional bicycle racing. The year is on the x axis and the total time is on the y axis. I designed it so that when you hover over a dot, it shows the rider's name, their nationality, the year, time, and the result of the allegation. The riders with doping allegations are colored red and the ones without allegations are colored green.
